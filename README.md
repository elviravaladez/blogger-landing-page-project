### What I Learned

This section will be updated to include some of my major learnings while working through this project. 

I will be writing these out and providing code samples of areas I would like to highlight to reinforce my knowledge.

When major learnings are shared, they will look similar to the code snippets below ðŸ˜Š:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued Development
